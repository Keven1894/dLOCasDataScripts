It is often stated that coffee
is a declining industry in Haiti.
If the statement refers to coffee
exporting, some statistical sup-
port can be found for it. If it
refers to coffee growing, the sta-

ve. In fact, one remarkable
thing about the industry is that

**Personable Governor Charles Poletti, Vice-President of the
New York World's Fair 1964-65 Corporation for International Af-
fairs and Exhibits and his distinguished wife Jean Ellis arrive |
here Thursday in company with Dr. George H. Benneit, a Ph.D.
ore of his eight Assistants.

Governor Poletti was met at the airport by Mr. Valentin Edward
Blacque, Commercial Attache at the U.S. Embassy and his charm-
ing wife Dorothea, and Mr.
American,

William McElhannon, Manager of Pan

International Lawyer Charles Poletti, former Governor of New
York, former Altied Military Governor of Italy during the Second
*Yorld War with the rank of Colonel, former Judge of the Supreme
Court of New York, was wearing in arriving here the insigna of the
Order of St. Gregory The Great with the rank of Commandor with
star given him by late Pope Wugenio Paceli for distinguished ser-
vices during the war. It’s the highest civ] order granted by the
Vatican.

Governor Poletti arrived from Jamaica where he was inviting
the new Republic to participate to the New York World’s Fair.
‘Ze had a meeting with Prime Minister Bustamente, with the Min-
isters of Finances, Commerce and Industry and also with the
President of the Chamber of Commerce and the Chief of the Jam-
nica Industrial Development Corporation, Mr. Braham to explain
‘Sem the peaceful purpose of this World Wide Exhibit.

Governor Poletti has met here Thursday with the Minister of
“ourism, Mr. Victor N. Constant and Friday morning was received
“y the Secretary of State of Commerce and Industry, Mr. Clovis
Mesinor and later on by the Minister of Finances and Econom‘c
Affairs, Dr. Herve Boyer. Friday afternoon he had a meeting with
shc President of the Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Louis Decatrel
hefere a Press Conference at the Chamber of Commerce.

The Vice-President of International Affairs and Exhibits at the °

New York World’s Fair speaks fluent French and was delighted
with the French Speaking Republic.

He left Haiti Saturday morning to go to Gai where he will be
received by President Arosemena who was his guest af the Fair
Grounds, three weeks ago and on to Bogota where the U.S. Am-
bassador is the cousin of his wife. Governor Poletti will end his:
teur in the Caribbean and Latin America with a visit in Caracas.

here for carnical next February. Jane and Josephine flew back —

Saturday after four days in San Juan...

~*Prominent New York Realtor James B. MacGuire, a popular
fit -ure here with three or four trips every year will have lots of
“ chories to tell back home. This fervent guest of the Gingerbread
Palace likes to reminisce these two stories. As I introduced him
-in French to spright Jacky Harris at the “grand bal’ of the
Cancer League at Cabane Choucoune on August 14, he mistook
‘my pretty companion for a Haitian and put on his best French

Society manners in saying: “Enchante de faire votre connaissance,

Mademoiselle.”

T am from New York, outspoken Jacky stopped him, you do not
have to “enchanter’’ me. This was called precious. It becomes
a famous line. The souvenir of Jacky’s visit here shall live long
through it,

The other one runs thus. Jimmy was going to Ibo Beach when
reaching the check point at Duvalierville (formerly Cabaret) he
feurd out that he didn’t take any of his papers with him. He con-

The Coffee Industry

(Continued from page 1)

Admittedly the data is very
unsatisfactory. Official records
may have. understated exports
for the earlier years. Population
figures are nothing more than
the roughest sort of estimate
until the Census of 1950 and, fin-
ally, some people in the coffee

_trade doubt if local consumption’

is currently as high as eight
livres per capita.
Nonetheless, what emerges for
me, at least, is a picture of a
more or less stable, mature in-
dustry (stagnating as to techno-
logy) and, as we shall see, res-
ponding somewhat sluggishly,
up and down to world price mo-
vements. The above ‘detracts no-
seriousness of
the underlying problem—the li-
- mited natural resource base and
stagnant technology. With some-
thing like a tripling of population
“since the. 1880's Haiti is still hea-
‘yvily dependent upon an export
industry which has shown no
signs of sustained, long-term
growth, ‘ i
Looking back over the whole
period it is clear that
there have. been several

ae marked movements up and

5

down in exports within the over-
all trend. It is difficult to escape

f

the conclusion’ that the most im-
portant single factor in determi-
ning these has been world price.

Certain internal factors, such
as heavy specific taxation, have
tended to magnify the effect of
price movements. Doubtless
other internal and. external de-
velopments have left their mark
on the trend line—in particular
the upset times before the Occu-
pation, readjustment to loss of
the French market in the mid-
thirties, the Hurricane of 1954
and shipping difficulties during
the World War. But even some
of these have been, in part at
least, caused by coffee price
movements or have been expres-
sed thru them. For example, a
good case can be made that in-
tense interna] disturbance is us-
ually associated. with low or fal-
ling coffee prices.

High export levels in the late
eighties and early nineties are
associated with somewhat more
than a doubling of coffee prices

with a price decline which be-

ic shift ‘in its markets, before

nues a slow rise in response to
the most rapid and sustained
price increase in the industry’s
history. Average annaul export
levels recover in thé early fifties
to within five to six million ki
los of previous highs, when the

rise is interrupted by Hurricane

Tiazel. My own guess, based on
data presented later in this sec-
tion, is that the 1954-56 to 1957-
58 average might well have
equalled that of 1929-30 to 1932,
33, had it not been for Hazel.
As mentioned above, the, out-
put response during the, 1950's
to the greatest price rise in the
industry’s history has been dis-
appointing—at least to date. An
adequate jnterpretation of what
has occured seems to turn on an

| appraisal of the effects of Hurri-

cane Hazel, On balance it is my
judgement that the effect of the
ptice rise was a good deal more
substantial than total export fi-
gures indicate. Tt ‘seems to me,
further, that there is a good
redson to believe that the ‘in-
dustry might have reached past
export peaks had it not been for
the Hurricane. Tf this is correct,

sve should find evidence of a.

substantial shift in the geogra-
phic production balance, with
large increases for certain areas,
unaffected by Hazel, offset by
declines in those ‘areas (Depart-
ment of the South) badly affect-
ed.

The basic -evidence on this
point is data on peasant deliver-
ies as recorded by the agents of
the Office de Controle et de De-
veloppement des Denrees d’Ex-
portation. It must be confessed
at once that the accuracy of the

figures leaves much to be de- |,

\sired, particularly for the years
1956-57 and 1957-58. t

We know from Customs data
that the average exports during
the three crop years before the
Hurricane were virtually the

same as the average for the
three crop years that foilowed.
Yet figures shows’ the aver-
age crop in the traditionally
strong’ Cayes and Jeremie dis-
tricts of the South was (for the
two together). 104,400 bags of 80
kilos for the three years before
and 97,500 for the three years
after Havel. The loss was balan-
ced off by a rapid expansion of
output in other parts of the
country—above all in the Cap-
Haitien district. What seems to
be indicated is that ja marked
expansion was underway
throughout the country, but was
reversed in the South—thus leay-
ing national totals more or less
constant.

One might be tempted to write
this conclusion off as based on
unreliable data, if it were not
confirmed by other, independent
evidence. Although there is by.
no means unanimity among ex-
porters on this point, three of the
medium to smajl exporters with
whom I talked as a”group esti-
mated that output in the South
would be at least 50,000 hags
higher today had it not been for
the Hurricane. Perhaps the most
interesting set of independent fi-
gures are the annual estimates
of the Provincial Branch Mana-

pects. A

The Riviera, the largest Hotel in Haiti, closed now
for over a year is one of the relics left in the trail of
Paul Weesner, now accused in the New York Supreme
Court of embezzlement of at least $500,000.

» The New York Times front-paged the charges made
against him as chairman of the Bon Ami Company,
_ based on an affidavit filed by his private secretary al-

from Bon Ami to'a private corporation controlled by’
_ Weesner. ee

such as the weil situated hotel Riviera should be left
to the termites and soft-rot. :

An effort should be made to return this once glam-
orous resort to the tourist circuit again. and soon.

AND MORE OX-CARTS FOR HAITI

The New York Journal of Commerce has a story on
the extension of a route for jet-airplane to Santo Do-
mingo by Venezuelan International Airlines. Viasa
| which has gateways in the U.S.A. at New York, New
Orleans and Miami with nine flights per week to Vene-
mela, will call at Santo Domingo once weekly north-
bound to New York and again once southbound.

| The Dominican Republic already has its (Compania
| Aerovias Dominicana) CAD making regular low-fore
flights to Miami and San Juan, Caribair, (Puerto Rican
Airlines) Varig, (Brasilian Airline) with regular reli-
|| able flights to Miami, New York and San Juan as well
as Pan American Airways. The adequacy of the air-
‘Services in the Dominican Republic accentuates the in-
adequacy of the jet services needed to develop Haiti’s
| economy.

 

CAB To RECONSIDER HAITI?
A news story out of San Juan, Puerto Rico this week

ton, D.C. is going to reconsider Caribair’s applications
for additional runs in the Caribbean and South Ameri-
ca. Although Haiti was not specifically mentioned it is
believed that this means Caribair’s long standing re-:
‘quest for a service to Haiti will be reconsidered in a
-)new light.

The new light, is Pan American’s reduction of pass-
‘enger flights and non-scheduled cargo traffic to Haiti.
All partisanship aside, with the large jet clippers of
Pan American World Airways over-fiying Haiti, it is
reasonable to give an opportunity to smaller lines with
less expensive planes to- service this country, sharing
jin mail contracts and other sources of revenue.

It is not a happy prospect in the age of manned space
flights to see Haiti isolated and reduced to four mails
\|per week. ‘

Although the building of a jet airport would remedy
uihe situation, even if it was begun tomorrow it would
“not be complete in’ at least a year. Something must be
| done in the meantime.

would expect recovery in that
district beginning in a year or
two. When added to further
growth in other districts, result-
ing from planting and improve-
‘ments up thru at least 1954, pro-
duction for the country as a
whole might be expected to
reach new highs within the next
five or six years. Something
that may happen, but I have
one or two serious reservations.
(On the basis of early indica-
tions, the 1959-60 crop looks like
_ the largest on record.)

From what I can discover,
there is very real doubt if the
damage in the South has been
made good. In fact there are
experienced people in the trade
who expect output in the South
to continue to decline in conse-
quence of exposure of both soil
and coffee plants and conse-
quent moisture problems. In
light of basically favorable
growing conditions in the South
and its traditional position as
the No. 1 Haitian coffee produ-
cing area, government action
would seem indicated. Perhaps
careful study would show that,

political considerations aside, a
national coffee development pro-
gram should concentrate first in
that area.

The second. reservation (per-
haps not as important in terms
of the next few years) concerns
the decline in world coffee pri-
ces, compounded .by heavy spe-
cific export duties. If the past
is a guide, any marked effect
of these should appear only after
a time log.

To return for a moment to the
question of price correlation,
answers to the really critical
questions are not at all clear.
Does the export response imply
something like an equivalent
production response? And, if so,
just how is that output response
brought about?

It is possible, of course, that
changes in export levels come
primarily from changes in the
pattern of internal consumption.
Doubtless this is a part of the
story, and does much to-account
for short-term export response
—within two years or so of pri-
ce changes, but it seems. un-
likely that it is the most im-

portant part of the explanation.
We are dealing with variations
from high to low of the four
year averages of some ten to
twenty million livres (even ex-
cluding war years) which are
large figures, indeed, as com-
pared with estimates of local
consumption. In addition that

‘explanation does not seem com-

patible with the substantial lag
in marked output response of
from five to ten years. Changes
in total production must be in-
volved here, even those changes
may be of smaller than the
changes in export levels.

The industry responds to mar-
ked and sustained changes in
the world price, but just what
does one mean by that? What
are the other prices which the
peasant compares with coffee
prices when he makes up his.
mind to change his course of
action? And when he does make
up his mind to respond, say, to
“high” coffee prices, what does

-the sacrifice in so doing—leis-

ure, other crops? Such are the
question which are at the very
heart of the matter. On the bas-
is of present knowledge “‘ans-
wers’’ must be very tentative.
A marked change (let us say,
vise) in world coffee prices
works its effect on the Haitian
coffee industry in three main
ways. First, it changes the price
relationship between coffee and
local food crops and creates: an
incentive for shifting peasant
labor and (in time) some land

from food to export crop use..

This. effect may well be tempor-
ary (unless coffee prices conti-
nue to move up) since higher
money incomes and inelastic (or
declining) supply of food soon
results in higher food prices.

The second effect is'a straight-
forward labor cost and coffee
price comparison. It seems pro-
bable to me that this has gra-
dually become of increasing im-
portance. Doubtless it was even
important when labor was paid
almost entirely in food. As noted
hereafter many of the heavy
jobs such as clearing, prunning
and clearing have always re-
quired more labor than that
available within a single family.

The third effect is a more ge-
neral one, bearing on peasant
willingness to put forward effort

and to take risk, high coffae
prices mean a_ change in
the terms of trade between cof-
fee and the small list of manu-
factures (mostly: imported
goods) which the peasant buys.
(Wheat, cotton cloth, soap, fish,
kerosene, roofing and hand
tools.) I am “reasonably confid-
ent that when these terms of
trade become more favorable,
the effect is to stimulate the
coffee industry—even tho it
may, at the same time, have
changed the price ratio between
manufactured goods and local
foods in favor of the latter.

The peasant is not lacking in
desires for things, but they seem
so un-attainable—or only attain-
able with such pain and risk—
that he ‘‘makes do’’ with a very
low living standard. More favor-
able terms of trade, if maintain-
ed over a period of years, pro-
bably results—not in a reduction
of effort as is often assumed—
but the contrary, It might well
be contended that such an effect
will work so gradually as to be
useless in interpreting develop-
ments over a decade or so. My
own guess is that, if the shift
in terms of trade are significant,
it will work in even a relatively
short time span. The two shifts
we have had since the late 1920's
have been violent ones. Between
the late 1920’s and the late
1930’s coffee prices fell by over
60. percent whereas wheat prices
were virtually unchanged; cloth
and soap came down 25 to 30
percent and fish 40 percent. Only
kerosene was relatively cheaper

i ee

than coffee. Between the late
thizties and mid. 1950’s coffee
prices went up by more than }
7.5 times whereas kerosene
prices did not increase; fish,
soap. and cotton cloth prices a
little more than double and
wheat prices quadrupled.

In the case of sustained high
prices there must be a certain
amount of planting, perhaps even
in the sense of encroaching upon
food crops. It seems certain
that, except in very unusual cir-
cumstances such as_ the first
year or so of the five-year plan,
practically none of the planting
is from nurseries. Rather, it is
the transplanting of naturally
seeded trees. It has been sug-
gested to me that such planting
is not characteristic of the very
small holdings, but rather of
“plantations” of (let us say) ten
hectares» or more where labor
may be hired for such tasks or
the culture is on a shares basis.

Perhaps of even mcre import-
ance, when prices are high.
This last seems to be even bet-
ter established than the first
two, but it is not helpful in
accounting for a heavily lagged
output response. é

To take the reverse case of
depressed coffee prices, there
seems to be little evidence of
sudden mass cutting of trees”
and replanting to other crops.
The reports of the National Bank
are interesting in this regard.

ments on the fact that there had
been no destruction. Rather the
pressure usually seems to take
the more’ gradual form of cut-
ting of shade in order to increa-
se interplanting of food crops
and thus gradual destruction of
the coffee plants: Pruning and
cleaning suffers at such. times
and it seems certain. that pick-
ing is less thorough—particularly
if laber is hired for these tasks.
There is doubtless something to
the commonly held belief that
gradual pressure for food crops
has pushed coffee into higher
altitudes in some parts :of the
country—altitudes where it has
some natural protection since
conditions for alternative crops
are nothing like as-favorable.

It is my guess that coffee out-
put in Haiti expands and con-
tracts with minimal effects on
production of other crops. The
labor poSition is, at least for
most of the year, one; of surplus
—primarily because of the drud-
gery and risk involved in any
attempt to increase real income.
In addition, there is a strong
belief among the peasants, (pro-
bably justified) that the land re-
source is often specifically adap-
ted to either coffee or food. And
finally, heavily populated as
Haiti is, it is hard to travel

 

 
  
 
 
 
 
 

 

 

throughout the country without
getting the impression that there
is still a good dea] of land avail-
able for coffee cultvur-e—land
which produces very little at the
present time. Perhaps even more
important for future policy for-
mation—it is perfectly clear that
changes in techniques could sub-
stantially increase production
with no pressure on land resour-
ces and very little on labor.

There are public policy impli-
cations from all of this. In 1958,
just as coffee prices sagged, the’
Government substituted. a heavy
specific duty for the mixed ad
valorem and specific coffee ex-
port tax, It seems probable that

‘the new tax will take a third or

more of a_ substantially lower
FOB price in the next few years.
If the past is any guide at all,
the effect on. production and ex-
ports will be marked, so marked
indeed that de facto devaluation,

in the form of a complex sys-

tem of exchange control might
result. The case for an immedia-
te reduction of the coffee export
tax and revision upward of im-
port duties (particularly on. non-
essentials) js extremely strong.
There may still be time to try
it out before more complex
measures become inevitable.
(One major difficulty with

tian case is that, since such a

have doubtless had some effect
on cleaning and pruning, on tho-

world market. Haitian Govern-

It is interesting to note that
the amount of washed coffee
fluctuates directly with the size

_ of the total crop. Actually, the

proportion washed is greater in
the heavy crop years, which is,

vestment over a period, even as
short as ten years, means a Ca-
pital cost of only about $1.00.
per 50 kilos. Out of pocket costs
may add another $1.50 per 50
kilos for a total cost different-
ial over pile—of $2.50 per 50 ki-
los. This may be considered as
a break-even point for a good-
sized plant working under near-
capacity conditions.

Present differentials (tax plus
market) amount to some $4.50
per 50 kilos in a $35 coffee mar-
ket which leaves a sizeable pro-
fit margin. Yet, there has ‘been
no move to build washing plants
in the past few years, and, in
fact, a nutnber were closed
down during the 1958-59 season.
Exporters are hoping for an
even more substantial tax dif-
ferential.

There is a real issue involved
here, of fundamental importan-
ce to development policy in a
country such as Haiti. Besides
the cost differential as calculat-
ed above, there are a number
of other things blocking success-
ful extension of washed coffee.

As might be expected, the
speculateurs are deadly  ene-
mies of the washing process.
They make the point with the
peasant, and a valid one, that

 

dependence: on washing plants
means that he loses the advan-
tage ‘ef ability to store his crop.
In the years of rising prices up
to 1954-55, the argument seemed
to have real weight—and a less-
on once learned may be hard
to unlearn. Unless the peasant
sees a very clear price advant-
age he will prefer pile, particu-
larly since he values the labor
that goes into its preparation
at little or nothing. In fact, the
making of pile, although hard
work, is often a social occasion.

The season for washing plants
is a very short one—usually las-
ting three or four months, and,

since the exporters are not per-

mitted to purchase coque (dried
cherries) from the peasants,
they cannot prolong plant oper-
ations by making cafe decorti-
que. Apparently this law was

passed in 1952 to pacify the spe-

culateurs.

Lack of adequate transporta-
tion facilities makes the task. of
repairing breakdowns and keep-
ing plants running at full capa-
city an extremely difficult one.
Risk of damaging the cherries
is great—thru delay yn bringing
them to the factories. Transpor-
tation difficulties being what
they are, the cherries are
brought in by burro or on ~ foot—

to extend operations the usual
practice is to ring the plants
with buying posts, which is, of
course, expensive.

Finally, the violent fluctua-
tions in Haitian output make it
difficult to adjust ‘plant capacity
to the industry’s needs and in-
evease the risk of periodic over-
capacity. ‘

By tax discrimination against
pile (subsidy of washed coffee)
these difficulties might be over-
come—if the tax discrimination
was severe enough. But some of
the blocks should not be ‘‘sugar-
coated over” in this way. They
should be cured rather than
compensated for. Examples may
be the following. Peasant resist-
ance might be lessened if he
had the choice of keeping his
parche (the product of the wash-
ing plant) if he did not like the
curent price on cherries. (This
would only work for fair-sized
lots and, of course, the peasant
would be charged for the wash-
ing.) Permitting the plants to
purchase coque and even pile
would be a major improvement.
The present prohibition is a
castly subsidy and political sop
to the speculateur. Compensat-
ing for primitive transportation
and communication facilities is
probably a poor substitute for
direct expenditure to improve
them. And finally, even the vio-
lent fluctuations in annual pro-
duction can be mitigated by a
sood extension program.

“What is the proper overall po-
licy? Does one push for basic
reform to reduce high costs or
compensate _the factories in or-
der that they may operate des-
pite them? The answer is pro-
bably a little of both, but, at
the least, policy makers should
realize precisely what they are
doing.

In the present situation, there
is much to be said for further
experiment in widening the tax.
differential as a stop-gap meas-
ure. But whatever differential is

tried it should not be created by -

a simple addition to existing tax
rates, If further discrimination
against pile is to have the de-
sired result, present prices to the
peasant for both cherries and
pile must fall. The price on pile
would fall by about the arnount
of the tax and that on green
cherries by an amount less than
the tax—just sufficiently less to
persuade peasants to sell thé
undried beans. Thus, the state’s
share would be substantially
greater (much greater,
more’ washing plants were
built). For a time, at least the
“differential”? would act just
about like a straight tax. in-

crease. In the present situation © 4

of extremely high taxes and fal-
ling prices, that is the last step
which should be taken. If the
differential tax is increased,
there is much to be said for a

_ washing plant

until |

SUNDAY AUGUST 26, 1952

Inevitably there are disadvan:
tages to a program — fosteving
washed coffee. However, they do
not seem to be too serious.

1—A part of the processing is
taken out of peasant hands —
and, if nothing else changed,
this would mean lower income.
As to whether or not the releas-
ed labor would represent wasted
labor, no one seems to know.
At the least, <it seems certain
that the peasant would gain by
improvement of harvesting prac-
tices; reduction of loss from
water damage during the dry-
ing season; and . reduction of
bean damage thru improper de-

corticating. There would, of
course, be some rural industrial
employment.

2—Some experts contend that,
if washed cotfee became domin-
ant, at least in certain‘ areas—
inability to store and reduction
of number of buyers in any one
area would undermine the com-
petitive structure of the indus-
try and expose the peasant to
exploitation. This is a real dan-
ger. Fortunately, an_ efficient
can be quite
small. There are still likely to
be a number of firms operating
in any given area. Also, the
shift to washed coffee will by
no means occur overnight. For
some time at least, it will be
easy for the peasant to return
to pile, as long as some specu-
lateurs are around. There are
many ‘coffee areas where lack
of water makes washing plants
impracticable and continuation
of something like present meth-
ods inevitable. (This is another
reason for a compensating re-
duction in the overall duty). It
seems unlikely that Haiti will

ever have more than 50 percent .

washed coffee.
Cooperatives

In a peasant economy, suffer-
ing from lack of organizational
centers to focus ‘economic and
other aspects of rural life, one

‘is always tempted to play up

«cooperatives as the panacea.
The temptation is even greater
if holdings are small and frag-
mented, and each peasant feels
himself obliged to diversify to
the point of virtual self-sufficien-
cy. Finally, as has been stated
a hundred times before by other
authors, there has long been an

 

indigenous element of cooperat- ¢

lve  penavior among Haitian
peasants—various sorts of com-
bites, or work associations.

Haitian intellectuals have long
been intersted in the cooperat-
ive movement, and there have
been many experiments — the
usual experience apparently be-
ing collapse within a year or
so. Cooperative programs are
underway today and are in the
opinion of many of the intelli-
gentsia the most important
strand of an attempt to modern-
ize Haitian peasant society. A
successful program is an extre-
mely difficult undertaking, te-
quiring patient education, first
class business management, and
guidance over long periods of
time. Perhaps it even requires
prior development of an effect-
ive extension system. ~

In any case a promising line
of approach, bearing on the cof-
fee industry but having wider
implications, might well be mil-
ling cooperatives— small plants
equipped to mill corn and rice
(where appropriate) and to de-
corticate coffee. Equipment for
such plants is reasonably inex-
pensive — a small decorticator
costs a little as 250 to 500 dol-
lars. I have seen a complete, pri-
vately owned, plant which might
have cost as little as eight to
nine thousand dollars.

- Technical and managerial pro-*

blems are nothing like as com-
plex as they are in washing
plants, and the milling could fit
into the seasonal pattern of lo-
cal agriculture. As far as cof-
fee is concerned, the plants

would provide a ney marketing

alternative for the peasant, by-
passing the speculateur. Mach-
ine decorticating also would
greatly reduce present’ loss thru
broken and flattened beans. The
little mills might provide a
more or less “‘sure fire’ point
in the productive process at
which to start and from which
it would be possible, ultimately,
to reach back to such problems
as credit, joint use’! of equip-
ment and better land use.

Commercial Plantations

As indicated earlier, there are
virtually no commerical planta-
tions in Haitan coffee growing.

ly if scattered holdings owned
by one man and worked on a
shares basis are taken into ac-
count. But they still remain rare
exceptions, and it seems pro-
bable that only two of the. total
are run on anything like a mo-
derm commercial basis. (The
government operated SHADA
plantetion at Bayeux and the
Shutt plantation. both in the
North).

There ig ~some evidence that
this was not the case even two
sor three generations ago (at
least as to size of holding). With
output at something like current
levels in the 1870’s one author
reported some 40,000 cultivators,
or. less than a third the number
now in coffee. Another report
claims that there were over
3,000 coffee plantations .of some
size before the internal disord-
ers preceding the American oc-
cupation. These years may well
have seen the rapid .decline of
medium-scale growing. In any
case by 1927-28 the annual re-
port of the Fiscal Department
of the National Bank raises the
question of why there are no
plantations. The report states
that suitable land is believed
to be available for purchase or
rental; that internal security
now exists; and that there is
abundant labor.

Changing culture practices
and expanding output would
doubtless prove much simpler

bly informed that there is. still
some private interest in such
undertakings, and that means of
encouraging coffee plantation
enterprise has- been given recent
consideration in government. cir-
cles. An old idea, which has a
very real appeal, is to require
establishment of small model
plantations as a condition for
bemg a coffee exporter. In or-
der not to handicap the smaller
firms, the number of h2ctares
of planting might be made con-
ditional upon the size of the
firms exports. Such a program
has its dangers, but if it were
designed simply to ‘“‘set the

tone” for peasant culture it
might make a_ real contribu-
tion.

The prospects for widespread
development of plantation grow-
ing ate by no means encoura-
ging. In part this is because of
the decline of the Provincial

“towns and the increasing divor-

ce of men of education and
wealth from the economic life
of the countryside. In part it re-
sults from residual anti-colonial
feeling. Strong state support
(necessary in acquiring sizeable
holding in a single block) is not
likely to be forthcoming; and
state regulation of, and interfer-
ence with, large plantation en-
terprise is greatly feared by ex-
porters who have considered
entering the growing end of the
business. Lack of adequate tran-
sportation facilities continues to
be a hurdle and, finally such en-
terprise requires stable govern-
ment and respect for law and

that Haiti is wedded to raisizg
its coffee on small, fragmented
peasant holdings—with all the
difficulties that entails in the
way of introducing better prac-
tices.

Tax Discrimination
Government has attempted for

many years (since 1929) to fa-
vor certain ‘‘types’’ of coffee

thru differentiation in the export

tax and, thereby, react back on
exporter and peasant methods.
The type classification is based
on number of defects—stones,
other foreign matter, _ broken

beans, yellow and black beans,

ete. Under present
the rates ru

legislation
from exemption

-on type 1 to $2.50 a bag of fifty

kilos for the lowest type.

Besides encouraging washed
coffee, there might be two other
effects of such a tax. It may
well have served to increase ex-
porter expenditure on hand sort-
ing. Even this is not certain
since better sdrting not only in-
creases the amount of higher
type coffee but also the amount
of low type triage which is hea-
vily taxed and sells at a dis-
count on the world market. On
balance, if hand sorting’ has
been encouraged, it represents
a net gain to the Haitian eco-
nomy—a recognition’ of the fact
that labor is even more plenti-
ful than the low minimum wage
of seventy cents a day indicates.
However, it does not seem to
me that this ‘should be the pri-
mary objective of the tax. Ex-
porters will almost certainly
find it worth-while to do a subs-
tantial amount of hand sorting
simply in response to market
premiums.

A second possible effect might
be to exert pressure for change
Of peasant practices. It seems
clear that, if this has been the
objective, the policy has not
been a success. Apparently ex-

porters do pay a differential
price in accordance to quality
of pile bought—a_ differential
varying from one dollar to two
dollars per fifty kilos. But it
seems to be based primarily on
water content— thoroughness of
peasant drying. I am told that
there is some differentiation on
the basis of cleanliness and size
of bean.

Coffee people tell me that,

present practices in. the trade

being what they are, no one
exporter can stand out against
the tide and offer real differ-
entials for quality. The custom
of - advances to  specuiateurs
against ‘‘tel quet’’, or whatever
the quality may be, is so strong
that an exporter who attempted
to discriminate would lose his
speculateur contacts. It is diffi-
cult for an economist to see why
a buyer should be discriminated
against by a seller because he
stands ready to pay a higher
price. But there it is—despite

‘repeated questioning the answer

from the exporters is always
the same. Were it not for the
inflated speculateur .cushion , be-
tween. exporter and peasant, it
might be possible to. design a
tax that would strengthen ex-
porter selectivity and react back
on peasant practices.

In’ any case, for the past
year or more the ‘‘quality tax”
has fallen into ill repute. With
government revenue needs at a
critical level all coffee tends to
be bad coffee and the system
degenerates into little more
than a flat tax and bitter bick-
ering and suspicions between
government and the exporters.
Under present circumstances
there is much to be said for
eliminating all differentials ex-
cept that in favor of washed
coffee. At least this type is eas-
ily reconginzable, and the wash-

ing process results in a reduction

 

the nearest thing to a ‘devil’

of the proportion of low grade —
product rather than an increase,
as is the case with sorting.
The Speculateur
The. speculateur emerges as

in our little play—if indeed ~
there is anything: resembling a —
devil except restricted econom-
ic opportunity and ignorance.
My reaction is to counsel cau-
tion—since the usefulness of
traders is seldom appreciated—
also since the money-lender is
hated in all peasant societies
and with some reason, except
that, who is thete ready and
able ‘to fill his function (however
badly performed)? Still, this is
a real trouble spot in the ‘trade.
It might be well to go packs a
bit in time.

By the end of the 1920's coffee
crops exceeding those of the
1930's were being handled by —
some 700 speculateurs — some-
what more than a third of the
number operating today. The

 

‘trade was a licensed one and

the fee five dollars for the sea ~
son. Apparently there were
many among the speculateurs of
some stature and substarice in
the Jocal community operating,
in part at least, independently
on their own capital. Shortly
thereafter the tax was reduced
and requirements markedly
loosened—by 1933-34 there were
over 5,000 speculateurs, a fig-
ure which doubtless also reflec-
ted the economic difficulties of
the times. Whereas their activi-
ties had been restricted to ma-
jor coffee centers, they now
were permitted to operate in
many more rural markets. In a
study, published in 1935, the
Chief Agronomist of the Depart-
ment of Agriculture pointed to
deterioration in the profession
of speculateurs as a major
cause of the recent decline in
quality of Haitian coffee.

SEDREN TO STEP UP

EXPLORATION

HERE

Despite all its efforts and the
considerable amount of money
spent, Sedren has not yet been
able to. produce copper concen-
trate in sufficient quantity to
make its venture in Terreneuve
a payable proposition. :The Com-
pany is not in a position to fili
all its pending orders, or to ful-
ly comply with its financial obii-
gations.
has successfully succeeded in
solving most of her problems
but the one the Company. is_ fa-
cing now is a human one, one
that has to do with the ability
of the Haitian miners to increa-
se the output Of copper ore. This
handicap, the Company hopes
to-.resolve it by establishing a
new time-table, a six days-
week of work, and by increas-
ing the number of mining shifts.
The miners will have to work
on Saturday and will receive 2
and a half times their regular
pay for that extra day; actually
no one will work more. than 8
hours a day and 40 hours a
week.

MALI

It is true that. Sedren:

Up. to now, the miners have
always refused to work on Sa-
turday; however, the Company
had many meetings with the
Union officials, and hope that
thanks to the good offices of the
Department of Labor they will
reach a mutually advantageous
agreement.

On the other hand Sedren has
just started some exploration
works at a place called Casseus
where a bed of native copper
was discovered some years ago
It is too early to say if the
volume and value in copper of
the mines at Casseus are worth
the large ‘sums of money that
will require the exploitation o°
that new venture. Sedren has
proven to be a very important
element in the economy of the
country, and we are seizing
this opportunity to wish to our
friend Fortune L. Bogat, Pres-
ident of that interesting enter-
prise our best wishes of suc-
cess.

Latin American-Coffee
Meetmgs of the principal cof-

to | fee-producing and consuming na-

tions of the World were initiated
on July 9th at the United Na
tions in New York, accordihg to
the N.Y. Times, and have had
a definitely successful trend.
The United States delegate to
the conference, Michael Blumen-
thal, Assistant Secretary of Sta-
te, expressed the opinion that’
the successful solution of coffee-
marketing problems was essen-
tial for 17 of the 20 Latin Ame-
rican countries which are de-
pendent on coffee revenue for
economie security. Without such
coffee-marketing stabilization the
Alliance for Progress could not
succeed.

The crux of the situation is the
acceptance of Latin American
coffee by the European Econom-
ic Community without being pen-
alized in Customs taxes as com-
pared to African affiliates of the
countries of the E.E.C. Mr. Blu-
menthal left the conclusion that
“It is generally understood that
fully acceptable pledges” have
been offered by the G.E.C. to
work for gradual reduction “and
eventual elimination of these
barriers to trade.”

The meetings are of fundamen:
tal importance to Haiti with the
preponderant proportion of our
external’ revenue dependant on
coffee.

Western Hemisphere coffee of
Arabian varieties has greater
consumer-appeal than the Java
varieties grown in Africa, and
elimination of tariff barriers in
ivurope will ‘mean the gradual
ctension of Latin American cof-

fee sales there.

derstanding of the problem?
Doubtless ‘so, but the problem
itself is a very tough one.

‘Renovation of peasant planta-

tions may well involve cutting |

down. existing trees in order
that those remaining may bear
more heavily. It may even mean
gradual renewal of substantial
acreage which’ entails missing a
crop during two or three years
and then a few years more of re-
duced crop. This is a harsh in-
vestment program to propose to
a very poor man. (This is not
to deny that much could be ac-
complished thru such simple
techniques as better mulching,
cleaning, pruning and_harvest-
ing.) And finally, it must-always
seem to the peasant that the
factors which really determine
income from coffee are beyond
his control—timing or rainfall.
and ‘other climatic conditions;
annual fluctuations of output
which no one seems to under-
stand; and prices which vary
substantially, apparently at the
whim of exporters er the govern-
ment. Re i

Demonstration plots, nurser-
ies, extension and all that goes’
with it are doubtless the answer,
but it is deceptively easy to say,
or write, the words. The Haitian
peasant might well respond to
a program involving several hun-
dred dedicated, imaginative,
young Haitian technician—prepa-
red to put twenty years of their
lives into hard, lonely rural liv-
ing. But just where are those
several hundred to be found?
Probably not among the forty
or so well-trained but city. orien-
ted agronomes who graduate
from Damien every two or three
years. A fresh approach, at least
might be to train substantial
numbers of peasant boys in the
‘areas concerned for specific,
simple extension tasks.

Financial cost is a barrier) all
right, but probably not the most
important one. Leupen estimated
the cost of even complete renew-
al at thirty dollars per hectare,
and the government is currently
using a similar figure. If the
estimates are meaningful, it
might take as much as $750,000
a year for seven years to cover
the whole industry. And this
would allow nothing for meeting
the peasants’ problem of curt-
ailed income in those cases
where it was necessary to cut
his trees. Even if the funds
should become available — for
sucess it must be assumed that
the men can be found; that there
would be real: continuity of gov-
ernment action; that the land-
tenure situation is not an over-
whelming obstacle; and that lack
of good trails and. roads into the
coffee areas will not make the
task too difficult.

Perhaps there may be easier
routes to progress than agricul-
tural extension
seems. doubtful. That there are
other measures which should be
taken is perfectly clear, but none
of them appear to be panaceas,
In fact, some seem even more
difficult of accomplishment.

the extension of cofive prepara:

in the long-run, the fostering of
cooperatives. Other poss*Pilities
are commercial plantations, us-
ing the tax mechanism to bring
pressure for better practices and,

finally finding a more creative

role for the speculateur.

Extending Coffee Washing
There is a good deal of agree-

‘ment in coffee ‘circles that .pro-

motion of washed coffee would
represent a major step in moder-
nizing the industry. Washed cof-

fee sells at a premium in the ©

world market—the price differ-

ential usually running ten per- ~

cent, or a little more, above the
average for pile. During the
boom of the 1950's this usually
meant a premium of around five
dollars per bag of fifty kilos.
Other advantages of extending
the washing process may be of
equal importance. Real gains
might be expected as a result

of greater control over peasant

harvesting practices (unripe
cherries can .be spotted. fairly
easily) and of reduction’ in num-
ber of broken and flatténed beans
associated with decortication by
mortar. Proponents of the wash-
ing process contend that there
would be an immediate reduc-
tion of broken, black, yellow and
undersized beans from twelve

percent of the crop to seven per-.

cent. With careful control in
buying, they believe that this
might be reduced even further.
The price difference between
such ‘‘triage” and good quality
washed coffee runs as high as
forty to forty-five percent.

The washing process is parti-

cularly important in cutting, los- |

ses in those areas of the coun-
try where rain is common dur-
ing the coffee drying Season.
Peasant methods require good
weather at this critical point,

and losses are often heavy. An]

expansion of washing facilities
would also strike a major blow
at the speculateurs—perhaps the

weakest’ point of the marketing

process; the washing plants pur-
chase direct from the peasant.

Finally, and by no means of

least importance, there are real
advantages to promoting any

simple, decentralized processing
industries in rural Haiti. There

would be a certain amount of
industrial employment, but-more
important the plants would re-
present economic focal points in
a society that seems to have a
erving need for institutional
forms of all sorts. The washing
plants should be centers for cof-
fee extension work. They are na-
tural gathering points for the
peasants—deep in the moutnains
at ‘good water locations, ‘ideal
for demonstration, nursery and
extension work.

Haiti is far behind other’ Latin
American producers in the pro-
portion of its crop treated by
the washing process. Introduc-
tion of plants was begun 1 earn-
est in the middle thirties but ne-
ver tovk hold as in the Domini-
can Republic, where a major
shift was accomplished, appar-
ently in a few years.

It is interesting to note that
the amount of washed coffee
fluctuates directly with the size

_ of the total crop. Actually, the

proportion washed is greater in
the heavy crop years, which is,
somewhat startling. It means, of »
